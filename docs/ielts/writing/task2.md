3. Positive or negative development (10%)
4. Advantages outweigh disadvantages (10%)
    1. you don't need to list both side, one side is enough

**Usually you need a point for concession**

**Use only one side of the viewpoint**

1. choose 3 high viewpoint
2. expand

## How to organize a point

+ high --> mid --> detail

+ abstract(conclusion) --> reasoning --> example

**NOT LISTING YOUR POINTS**

### Some abstract point:

+ Effectiveness & efficiency
+ Economy & finance
+ environment & health
+ equlity & fairness
+ feasibility & compatibility
+ culture & globalization
+ technology & internet
