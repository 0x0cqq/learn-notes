    No, actually.

    I didn't think they are skills that I would need in the future, so I didn't manage to get draw or painting education.

    So, I'm a bad painter now.

???question "Have you ever visited an art gallery?"
    I have a very rare experiene of visiting art galleries, and I only remember going as a part of a school trip.

    Actually, I'm lack of the sense of art, so visiting an art gallery is a touture[ˈtɔrtʃər] for me.

???question "Do you like looking at drawing or painting?"
    Well, though I have no idea about the techniques of drawing, I can still appreciate the beauty of art.

    I think to understand the beauty in the color, the lines of a drawing, you don't need to have a sense of art.     

???question "Would you like to learn more about art in the future?"
    It depends.

    I don't think I'm a talented drawer, so learning drawing is impossible for me.

    But, I'm quite interested in the art history, such as how art was connected to the history period when they were created. 

    I think these are more valuable.

## Finding and losing things

???question "What kind of lost things have you found in a public place?"
    Lots of things.

    smartphones and textbooks in classroom.

    Student card in school campus,

    also citizen's id card in subways.


???question "What would you do if you found something valuable, for example a phone?"
    If I found something valuable...

    Firstly, I will try to learn who owns this thing, maybe there is name on it, there is phone numbers.

    Secondly, I will try to find the owner by the telephone number, or there is message on it.

    Lastly, I will return the phone to its owner.

???question "Have you ever lost something which was found by a stranger?"
    Yes I once lost my student card and it was found by a student who is also in our school. 

    However, I did not know him, He found me just by the department information on my student card.

    So I really appreciated him because I have to pay twenty Yuan if I had lost that card.

???question "Would you ever ask for help on social media to find something you'd lost?"
    Yes I lost my phone last semester.

    And when I found that my phone was lost, I used my roommates phone and sent a lost and found in schools’forum.

### Email

???question "Is email popular with everyone in your country?"
    Email is not very popular in my country.

    That is because we have many more ways to communicate with each other like wechat video calls.

    That is almost all I need if I want to contact with people.

???question "Do you send a lot of emails?"
    No, I do not send a lot of emails.

    Personally I dont have many reasons to use email.

    I use email only when I need some formal communication with teachers departments and schools.

???question "Do you prefer to email people or to speak to them on the phone?"
    Personally I prefer to speak them on the phone.

    That is because I can send much more information on the phone rather than just typing a few ores in the emails.

???question "Do you think people will use email more or less in the future?"
    I think people will use less emails in the future.

    I am a student of computer science.

    Email is just the production of time when people cannot send a lot of information by the Internet.

    With the development of technology, people today have lots of ways that are more advanced, more easy, more convenient to use.

## Daily Routine 

???question "What do you usually do in the morning [before starting your work or studies]?"
    I have a very tight morning schedule.

    I have to prepare for my class in less than thirty minutes because I usually get up late for more sleep.

    After I wake up, I make my bed and then I wash my face, brush my teeth, and go to the canteen for breakfast, and then ride to the class.

???question "Do you prefer to go to bed early or late?"
    I prefer go to bed early.
    
    Because it is not only good for my health, but also a way to increase my rest time, giving me more energy to work and study.

???question "Do you like to do the same things every weekend?"
    I don't like to do the same thing every weekend.

    Weekend is the only free time between work, we shouldn't do something that is very ordinary at that time!

    Whether it is trying a new restaurant, watching a new movie or hanging out with new people. There should be something new to make weekend not boring.

???question "Is your daily routine going to change in the future?"
    I'm not satisfied with my current routine because it is not healthy.

    Maybe I'll try to sleep earlier and get up earlier place more exercise time into my routine.

## Dreams

???question "How often do you remember your dreams after you wake up?"
    I often forget my dream a few minutes after I wake up, so I rarely remember them.

    Before I forget it I usually just remember a few of the fragments of my dreams.

???question "Do you like hearing about other people’s dreams?"
    I really like hearing about other people's dreams.

    Because I am a people who don't dream a lot, and my dream are most realistic, which means they are boring.

    So listening to other people's dreams which has a lot of interesting stories is quite a complement for my lacking of dreams.

???question "Do you think dreams can have special meanings?"
    No I don't think dreams have special meanings.

    Dreams are just a reflection of your thinking in the day.

    So they don't have special meanings such as the prediction to the future.

???question "Would you like to learn more about the subject of dreams?"
    I am not interested in learning more about dreams.

    Personally I believe most serious dreams are very unreliable.

    So I think it's a waste of time to study theories about dreams.

## Cell phones

???question "Do you like using a cell phone?"
    Yeah I like using a cell phone.

    I use my phone all the time, it's rarely out of my hand.

    I use my cell phone to get news to contact with my friends and to learn new knowledge from apps.

???question "Do you send many text messages?"
    Yes I send a lot of text messages to my friends.

    We mainly talk about sports, the subject we are learning, and also share our daily lives.


???question "When did you first have a cell phone?"
    I first got my cellphone in my primary school when I was in grade four.

    It was a old cell phone with android system, I could use wechat to contact with my parents if they wanted to pick me up in school.


???question "Are there any places where you would not use a cell phone?"
    Yes, a very few moments that I don't want to use my phone.

    For example, when I am studying and I'm visiting some beautiful places with my friends

    Using cellphones on these occasions is so unworthy.

## Cinema 

???question "Did you go to the cinema a lot when you were a child?"
    Yes I went to the cinema, a lot when I was a child.

    My father loved to watch science fiction films.

    So, he always took me to the cinema, the new science fiction film was out.

???question "Did you go to the cinema a lot when you were a child?"
    I still like a lot of the same movies that I liked when I was a child.

    As an adult today, I'm still a big fan of science fiction which my father liked a lot.

    By the way, a few days earlier I went to the cinema to watch the fourth episode of the matrix


???question "Do you prefer to go to the cinema with friends or on your own?"
    I prefer to go to cinema with my friends.

    Because watching movies is a good chance for socializing

    After the movie ends we can discuss about the stories in movie

    And as movies is usually quite long we can maybe take dinner or lunch together

???question "Which is more popular in your country: watching movies at movie theatre, or watching movies at  home?"
    I think watching movies and movie theater is popular now

    However, with the development of television people nowadays like to watch movies, more and more at home.

    Watching movies on TV is more convenient and cheaper than going to the cinema.
